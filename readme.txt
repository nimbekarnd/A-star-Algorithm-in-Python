#Astar Algorithm using Python 

Project 3 Phase 2 - ENPM661:


##Instructions for running the code:

-Two py files are required to run the program. (astar_ridid.py and astar_class.py). Make sure both the file are in the same directory.

We recommend you to run the program using the terminal in linux.

-Run the file named astar_rigid.py to execute the code.

The program will first ask you to enter the start row , column , orientation of the robot.
The program wil then ask you to enter the goal row and column.
Next the program will ask for the radius and clerance of the robot.



##Python files needed:

astar_ridid.py
astar_class.py



##Result:
The blue region is the explored region. The green region is the unexplored region. And lastly, the red region is the path from the start node to goal node.
If there is no solution then the output will be 'No valid path'.
if there is a solution you can see the path in the pop up


#For example:
For the start node (50, 30, 60), goal node (150, 150), radius = 1 and clearance = 1, the time taken is 50 seconds.

### Environment Required:

- Python: 3.6.9
- numpy
- heapq
- math
- OpenCV

To run the .py files, use Python 3. Standard Python 3 libraries like numpy, heapq, math and OpenCV are used.
